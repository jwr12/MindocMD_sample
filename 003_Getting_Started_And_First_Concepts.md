# Getting Started and First Concepts

<!-- -->

1.  **What Counts as a Historical Document?** MinDoc publishes
    historical documents.  But what counts as a historical document? In
    theory, pretty much anything. Any artifact or object--whether it's a
    text, a picture, film, a sound, a rock, a classroom chair with
    initials carved in it--could tell someone something about the past
    it came from. If you have something that you think can help people
    understand history better, and you want to share it online, then
    MinDoc can help you publish it. 

<!-- -->

2.  **What Makes This a 'Documentary Edition'?** An edition is a
    presentation of something: a publication, something you put out into
    the world (or in this case, online). A *documentary* edition
    (sometimes called a historical edition) is publication that presents
    an artifact so it can be used to explore history. In other words, the goal of this kind of edition
    isn't to present the *best* version of something (whatever that is), or the one that is
    somehow truest to some ideal---it\'s not a revised
    novel or a Director's Cut.  A documentary edition seeks to present
    readers with a published version of an actual document as it has come down to us, so
    they cite it as evidence about the past. 
    People publish documents for a number of
    [reasons](https://elaboratories.org/courses/why-edit/):
    to help a history be more widely known or studied; to make it more
    accessible; to enter it into the public record so it can be cited;
    to preserve it.  The Association for Documentary Editing
    [defines](https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/?page_id=508)
    a digital documentary edition as an electronic publication of
    "primary source material prepared with 1) rigorous attention to the
    text, 2) explanatory annotation and 3) an explanation of the
    editorial practices used on the texts." Our template is designed to
    help you create a documentary edition that meets these
    standards.

3.  **How Do I Get a Digital Copy of My Source?** One thing you'll need
    is the ability to create a digital copy (file) of your source.
    MinDoc doesn't digitize things or make copies for you. But chances
    are you already make digital copies of things all the time, using
    your phone's camera or an audio or video recording app.  Most
    cameras, printers, and copiers can be used to create digital images
    of things; many public libraries have scanners as well.  To create
    typeset versions (transcriptions) of texts, you can also type them
    into a word processor, thereby making a digital file (and that's
    also 'digitization!').  We discuss this process in more detail
    below. 

<!-- -->

4.  **Do I Have to Worry About Copyright?** Yes. MinDoc can't solve
    copyright questions for you.  To determine whether you have the
    right to publish something, you'll need to do your own evaluation.
    Many things are in the public domain and can be freely used,
    however, and many other things may be publishable by making a 'Fair
    Use' claim.  For a guide to evaluating what your options may be
    under U.S. Copyright law, see the [Fair Use (FAQ) \| U.S. Copyright
    Office](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html).  
    We also highly recommend Neel Agrawal's great course on securing
    permissions, freely available through the
    [eLaboratories](https://elaboratories.org/courses/securing-permissions/)
    website.

5.  **What Else Should I Be Thinking About?** Just because we can
    publish things, doesn't mean that we should.  Questions of legal
    ownership and copyright are important, but they're not the end of
    the conversation.  Is there someone else -- a person, a community --
    whose permission or opinion about this you should seek?  Do you feel
    good ethically and morally about publishing this material?  Although
    it's hard to make a definitive list of everything you might want to
    think about, take a moment to reflect on questions outside
    copyright.  If you want some examples of things you might want to
    think about, here's a list.

# **Researching Your Source** 
 
 MinDoc is a platform for publishing your document. But what do you need to know to present it to readers and viewers?  What kinds of information should you be prepared to offer about it, and what are some good kinds of questions to ask, in order to get there?  Libraries are full of information, as is the Internet.  But how should you plan your research about your source? Here are a few different approaches you might take, each with its own set of questions.  You can do them in any order, though we would suggest the following.

1. **Read Your Source (and Study it as a Text)** It may seem obvious, but one place to start your research into your source is by reading it carefully.  If it's a text, do all the words make sense to you? Are any obscure? Do you understand what kind of text it is (what its genre is)? What purpose did it serve? What kind of information was it meant to provide? What other kinds of information do you see in it? Answering these questions for yourself will do a lot to help prepare you to answer them for potential readers.

2. **Get to Know Your Source's Life Story** It also helps to begin by getting to know the biography or 'life story' of your document.  Like people, documents have a point of origin; they move through the world; they get involved in different activities, influence events; and they are changed by them.  How and when was your documented created? By whom (or what)? Why? How did it circulate in the world? What place did it have in society? Who used it, and how? How has its physical form or content changed over time? By what process (was it censored or did someone spill coffee on it)?  Some documents have long and complex life stories; others have much shorter ones.  But by getting to know the biography of your source to start, you'll get a firmer grip on what kind of picture of the past it can provide in its current form (as well as what it might have said earlier).

3. **Consider Your Source's Place in History** Typically, when people think about researching a document, they think first about placing it in 'historical context.'  That's certainly worth thinking about, but it also can mean two quite different things.  On the one hand, we could think about the broad history surrounding the document's production and life in the world (a lot of which you can learn by studying its biography, above).  What basic points about the larger time seem helpful to have in mind when reading your document? On the other, we might think about what role the document could play in our attempts to understand the past today.  What particular kind of light does it shed upon the past?  What existing debates does it speak to, what new questions might it allow us to ask? For example: A letter written by a family member suffering from influenza in 1918 (for example) might contribute to your family's history, but it also might help tell the story of a larger, global pandemic.  So think about it: what kinds of history does your source make possible?
    
4. **Gather Good Bibliographical Information about Your Source**  All of the approaches described above are more or less free form: you ask broad questions, seek out reliable sources, and develop answers in whatever format you please.  Not all of the information you collect may end up in your edition, but all of it will help you present your source.  When you study your source bibliographically, however, you're trying to look at it as an information scientist or cataloger might.  You'll be looking for specific kinds of information (bits of data about the source, or what's called 'metadata'), that you can use to describe the work in a standardized form or scheme.  To describe written texts, information scientists often draw inspiration from a standard developed by the Dublin Core™ Metadata Initiative ('[Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/), an initiative that has guided the development of international metadata standards for search and retrieval since 1994 . For images and recordings, scholars also use the standards developed by the International Press Telecommunications Council ([IPTC](https://iptc.org/standards/)).

5. **Preparing to Share Your Research** Once you've researched your source, you'll understand it better for yourself.  How will you share this knowledge with others? Most editions contain some written editorial remarks or commentary.  This might include things like an introduction, outlining your aims and ambitions in publishing your source; a short biography or history of it; explanatory footnotes or annotations; a statement of copyright and / or other permissions; and so on. It's also critically important to tell your readers about where your source comes from--where it is today, if it's a physical object--and what you did to it to put it on line.  Are you presenting all of the source, or just part? Was it in color, and your copy is black and white? If you transcribed it--turning handwritten notes into typed ones--how did you do that? For example, did you keep the original spelling and punctuation?  Did you include--or leave out--obvious mistakes or typos? Collectively, this editorial commentary is often called the 'editorial apparatus' of the edition.  And it helps readers use your source and also establishes your own trustworthiness as a publisher. 

6. **Starting to Write: Logistics** How can you get started writing? Most basically, you can just fire up a text editor or word processor and start writing.  To cut and paste your text into the right places in your edition, you'll need to save them as plain text (.txt).  As you get comfortable with Markdown (see above) go ahead and use its simple language to begin to format your text as you like. (That is, go ahead and write in Markdown.)

7. **Organizing Your Thoughts Using the MinDoc Template** Okay, but how should you go about organizing your information?  By design, MinDoc is flexible, and you can edit your presentation to provide as much--or as little--of your own commentary as you like.  That said, MinDoc itself is a template that provides you with a guide for how to present your research.  By default, your edition has sections you can keep and use.  Each of them seeks to answer one or more of the questions people typically ask of editions (and editors) when looking at publications of historical sources.  By building out your edition on this template, you'll be encouraged to provide this critical information.  
    
**Step by Step Description of the Template**
        1. **Home Page**: Every edition opens with a Home Page.  This is an image (upload an image of your choice), a title (you need one!), and the names of any authors. This might include both the original author of a text you've edited for publication ("By John Randolph") and your own name as editor ("Edited by John Randolph").  Note: this information should match the information you provide in the YAML files of your edition (see above).
        2. **Introduction**: This is the first written element of an edition: the first content readers encounter. The purpose of this introduction is to set the scene: to provide an initial description of the Source as well as an overview of the contents of the edition, highlighting its features and supplements. This is not a space for great detail about the Source, or your editorial work with it; later sections will allow you to do that. Here, your job is to help readers understand what they are looking at by establishing what it is and why it is interesting. The premium is on precise, no-nonsense prose, with a target length of no fewer than three and no more than six paragraphs. Suggested word count: 250–450 words
        3. **The Source**: This page provides the main presentation of your source, as you have prepared it for readers (i.e., a facsimile, transcription, video, audio clip, etc.). This section is where we satisfy the first of the ADE’s three criteria for an electronic edition by providing a rigorous, accurate presentation of historical material. For the presentation of some sources, it may make sense to break up the presentation into multiple Scalar pages. Nonetheless, this page should be the page from which all presentations of the source itself start. This may also be a space where editorial annotations are provided, such as notes on provenance, archival location, transcription, and more. If possible, a link to the source’s permanent digital location should be included here as well as a citation for that location. This should be done in consultation with the instructors, editorial board, and peer reviewers. 
        4. **About this Source**: This section contains a short biography or history of your source.This section represents the core of the contextual research we provide to satisfy the second of the ADE’s criteria for Electronic Editions. This section helps readers understand the context in which the source was made, and the kinds of historical topics and questions it illuminates. As outlined above, this biography of your source might answer questions like: How, when, and where was this artifact created? For what purpose? To what effect? Who used it, when, where, why? What sorts of histories and historical debates has it been used in? How might we use it in our explorations of the past today? Suggested word count: Up to 2000 words.
        5. **About this Edition**: This section provides your statement of editorial principles (the philosophy behind the choices you made) and describes how you created the edition. It helps satisfy the last of the ADE’s three criteria for Electronic Editions, by providing an explanation of the editorial practices used in making the edition. It answers such questions as: What original artifacts were used in the making of your edition? Where may they be found today? What procedures and technologies did you use in making your presentation of this artifact? What are the advantages—and what are the limitations—of this approach? What kinds of alterations or emendations (if any) have you made? How are they noted? In short, this section contains your statement of the principles and ambitions that guided your creation of this edition. The prose should be clear, short, and to the point; there is no minimum word length.  We also recommend adding a citation guide here: how would you like other people to cite your work?
        6. **Bibliography**: What books or other resources did you use in your work? Providing a list of references here will help your readers know if they can trust your work, and also help them do their own research.
