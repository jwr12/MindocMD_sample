# How to Build Your Site on GitHub

5.1.  **Establish a Repository with Your Copy of MinDoc In It**: The first
    thing you'll need to do---to build your website---is to create a
    copy of our MinDoc template that you can alter to suit your needs
    and put into something Git Hub calls 'a repository.' A repository is
    just a collection of files within a larger project (in this case
    MinDoc). So in this step you will create a clone copy of the MinDoc
    files, within a repository you will name as your own.  To create the
    site, you'll then be revising these files to reflect your content
    (adding all the elements of your edition: the source, your
    commentary, footnotes, etc.) You will revise these files to make
    your website.  To create your Repository, with your new copy of the
    MinDoc template in it: 

<!-- -->

5.1.1.  **Sign in to GitHub**.  If you don't already have an account, create
    one. Go to [[https://github.com]](https://github.com/)
    and select "sign up" at the top right corner. 

<!-- -->

5.1.2.  **Go to the *[MinDoc
    Repository]*](https://github.com/SourceLabUIUC/MinDoc)** 
    This is where you will find all the MinDoc files.  Don't worry about
    knowing what they all mean yet (we'll get to that). 

<!-- -->

5.1.3.  **Create Your Own Repository**: Click on the big green button on the
    top right of the screen: ![Alt text](image.png). It will provide you with two options.  Choose
    "Create a New Repository."  



<!-- -->

5.1.4.  **Choose a Name for your Brand New *MinDoc* Project.**  Simple is
    usually best: something that immediately tells readers what they are
    looking at. (You can change this later under "Settings", "General",
    "Repository Name". Type your updated name for the project and click
    "Rename".)

5.1.5.  **Set the Preferences.** The default setting is public repository.
    Do not change this, as you can only deploy a website if the
    repository is public. Your settings should mimic the preferences in
    the example below: 

<!-- -->

5.1.6.  **Click Create Repository**. You're done. Now you can start creating
    your first project.
