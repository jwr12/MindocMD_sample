# Initial Testing of Your Site

6. Initial Testing Your Site

6.1. Checking that Your Template Works. So your new copy of MinDoc
already can be converted into a website, using GitHub's tools. It's just
a blank website (for now), since you haven't added any content. Still,
it makes sense to make sure you can deploy your site before you put more
work into it. Here's how.

6.1.1. Go to the Settings Tab and Choose 'Pages'. It's in the top left
bar.

6.1.2. Set the Site to Deploy from Main Branch. See illustration below.
Click on the Save button. The \"branch" refers to your unique version of
the MinDoc repository. The main branch is considered the most simple,
stable, and deployable branch. By selecting the main branch, all your
edits will be merged and displayed on your website. As a side note, if
the name of your GitHub repository differs from \"mindoc,\" replace the
content of the line \"baseurl\" in the config.yml folder with the name
of your repository, which is the name you selected when you initially
created your own repository in step 5.1.4. You can find the "config.yml"
folder under the "Code" button at the top left hand of the screen. The
"config.yml" folder is near the bottom of the page. Be sure to copy the
name exactly (e.g., \'baseurl: \"/mindoc\"\' \--\> \'baseurl:
\"/example\"\').

6.1.3. Reload the Page. The link to your website will appear at the top
of the same page. This may take several minutes, so don't worry if your
link isn't immediately generated.

6.1.5. Copy and Store Your New URL So You Have It Handy. Copy the link,
then click on the 'Code' page (top left). Find the 'About' section (on
the right). Click on the Settings button, which is just to the right of
"About" and looks like a gear. Then paste the URL (the website's
address) in the "Website" line to always have it at hand.

6.1.6. Click on Your New URL. It will bring up your site. Since you
don't have any content in it yet, it should look like this.
