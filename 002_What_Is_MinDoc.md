# What Is MinDoc?

1.   **What is MinDoc? ** [MinDoc](https://github.com/TonLeon/mindoc) is
    a digital documentary publishing template that anyone can use to
    create a high-quality digital edition of a historical source. 
    MinDoc has been designed to meet the basic [standards for digital
    editions](https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/?page_id=508)
    set by the [Association for Documentary
    Editing](https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/), while also
    incorporating [minimal
    computing](http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000646/000646.html)
    design principles.  It requires only very basic computing resources,
    while at the same time teaching users some important coding skills.
    MinDoc was developed by researchers at
    [SourceLab](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/activities/sourcelab-journal),
    a digital humanities collective based at the [University of Illinois
    Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). It is distributed freely
    for any use under an [[MIT
    license](https://opensource.org/license/MIT/).]{.underline}

2.   **How Does MinDoc Work?** MinDoc is a template (or model) that can
    be used to create a simple but effective website containing your
    edition. This website may be hosted almost anywhere and made as open
    or as private as you like. You'll build it on Github---a
    freely-accessible space for programmers and web developers, used all
    over the world---using a built-in software tool called
    [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) . You don't need to know how to
    install or use Jekyll (unless you want to). It's possible to build
    your whole site online on Github.  It works best if you take the
    time to learn a few simple coding concepts, and a very basic (and
    easy) tool for formatting your text, called Markdown. (Widely used,
    Markdown will give you a skill you can bring to all kinds of
    projects and jobs in the future.) But, strictly speaking, all you'll
    really need to have to get your site built is patience, a
    willingness to play around, and some content. MinDoc can guide you
    on how to build the rest!

3.  ** What Can MinDoc Publish?** MinDoc is designed to put almost any
    kind of digital file onto the Web: from images to sounds to texts to
    video.  More specifically, MinDoc publishes digital documents
    together with the information people need to use these sources to
    discuss, analyze, and provide evidence for history.  By placing your
    documents in this frame, you can help create a better historical
    record online, so that students, teachers, researchers, members of
    the public, and future generations can make use of them**.**

4.  ** What Kind of Website Will MinDoc Produce?** MinDoc will help you
    create a so-called 'static' website.  This means that your website
    will not be dynamically updated by an external database. It won't
    feature new content based on automatic updates, it won't
    auto-populate content based on user preference, or anything else
    like that.  What you put in is what will be shown on the page.  The
    advantage of a static website over other kinds of sites, however, is
    that they are simple to host.  Because they don't depend on external
    resources like databases, they are also easier to preserve (a
    valuable thing for a documentary edition).

5.  ** What Will I Learn as I Do This?** You'll learn to edit basic
    files and gain elementary coding skills in the elementary
    programming language Markdown. This, in turn, will help prepare you
    to produce web content across a number of different
    platforms---blogs, e-journals, websites, social media,
    newsletters---and help you get ready to tackle more advanced web
    development skills.  You'll also get introduced to the world of
    [[Github]{.underline}](https://github.com/)---a universe of content
    by programmers and scholars all over the world---as well as the
    principles of documentary editing that shape scholarly efforts to
    publish the past today.  For a larger course on the craft of
    documentary editing, see the wonderful
    [[eLaboratories]{.underline}](https://elaboratories.org/) website

    Virginia's]{.underline}](https://www.virginia.edu/) [[Center for

    in collaboration with the [[National
    Archives]{.underline}](https://www.archives.gov/).
